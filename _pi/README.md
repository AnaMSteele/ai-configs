# Pi Configuration

This directory contains Pi-specific resources:

- `prompts/` — prompt templates exposed as slash commands
- `agents/` — @tintinweb/pi-subagents-compatible agent definitions
- `extensions/` — Pi runtime extensions, including the maintained `/plan` and `/prd` mode workflows

Repo-owned shared installable Pi skills live in the repo-level `skills/` tree, and `skills/install-matrix.json` also inventories package-backed shared skills fetched via `npx skills`. The installed shared runtime location remains `~/.agents/skills`.

The prompt templates are copied from `_omp/commands`, and the agent definitions are ported from `_omp/agents` into the flat markdown format expected by `@tintinweb/pi-subagents`.

## Installation

These resources are installed by `install.sh` to Pi's global agent directory. There are two distinct Pi installation surfaces:

- repo-managed extensions: copied from this repo into `~/.pi/agent/extensions/`
- package-managed Pi installs: registered via `pi install` / `pi update` and visible in `pi list`

`pi list` only shows the package-managed set; it does not list repo-managed files like `todo.ts`, `simple-multi-status.ts`, `pi-plan-mode`, or `pi-prd-mode`. See [Package-managed Pi extensions](#package-managed-pi-extensions) below for the exact git and npm package set.

```bash
./install.sh --pi      # Install Pi prompt templates + subagents + extensions and sync shared skills
./install.sh --all     # Install everything, including Pi
```

## `lsp-pi` provisioning

`install.sh --pi` now handles two separate LSP concerns:

- registering `npm:lsp-pi` with Pi so the `lsp` tool exists
- best-effort provisioning of the curated server subset that current `lsp-pi` actually knows how to spawn

Phase 1's curated npm-managed subset is:

- `typescript-language-server` → `typescript-language-server`
- `@vue/language-server` → `vue-language-server`
- `svelte-language-server` → `svelteserver`
- `pyright` → `pyright-langserver`
- `typescript` as a runtime fallback package for TypeScript-family workspaces that do not provide a local `typescript` dependency

Curated provisioning only runs when all of the following are true:

- `npm` is available
- the resolved npm global prefix is writable without `sudo`
- the resolved npm global bin directory is already on `PATH`, or it is one of the hardcoded fallback directories current `lsp-pi` already searches (`/usr/local/bin` or `/opt/homebrew/bin`)

`typescript` is installed as runtime support, not as a separate LSP server. If that package cannot be installed, the installer and verification script report degraded TypeScript-family fallback support rather than claiming total curated-provisioning failure.

Phase 1 deliberately leaves these surfaces unmanaged and informational-only:

- `gopls`
- `rust-analyzer`
- `dart`
- `sourcekit-lsp`
- Kotlin servers (`kotlin-lsp`, `kotlin-language-server`)

Phase 1 also deliberately does **not** claim support for Astro, YAML, Bash, or Dockerfile language servers, because current `lsp-pi` does not spawn them.

To verify both Pi package registration and curated binary usability, run:

```bash
bash scripts/verify-pi-install.sh
```

The canonical smoke fixture for end-to-end TypeScript `lsp` checks lives at `thoughts/fixtures/lsp/typescript-smoke/index.ts`.

```

The installer copies the repo-root `APPEND_SYSTEM.md` into `~/.pi/agent/APPEND_SYSTEM.md`. For OMP, that same shared source file is installed as `~/.omp/agent/SYSTEM.md`, matching OMP's `SYSTEM.md` additive-system semantics.

```

## Prompt Templates

Pi loads prompt templates from `~/.pi/agent/prompts/`.

Each Markdown file becomes a slash command using the filename:

- `cmd:debug.md` → `/cmd:debug`
- `cmd:execute-plan.md` → `/cmd:execute-plan`
- `dev:plan.md` → `/dev:plan`
- `dev:plan-from-prd.md` → `/dev:plan-from-prd`
- `prd:clarify-round.md` → `/prd:clarify-round`
- `review:change.md` → `/review:change`
- `review:prd.md` → `/review:prd`

Prompt templates in this repo are kept as top-level files in `_pi/prompts/`, so no extra nested prompt-directory discovery is required.

The `/plan` command is provided by the `pi-plan-mode` extension, and the `/prd` command is provided by the `pi-prd-mode` extension, not by prompt templates.

## Extensions

Pi loads runtime extensions from `~/.pi/agent/extensions/`.

This repo now ships a maintained `pi-plan-mode` extension that:

- powers `/plan` mode for `thoughts/` planning workflows,
- keeps planning-mode file writes scoped to `thoughts/`,
- surfaces `/review:plan` after plan edits as a non-blocking next step,
- automatically follows a standard review with `/review:change-integrate` before any execution handoff,
- keeps `/review:plan-adversarial` available as an optional second-pass challenge review after integration,
- leaves execution handoff manual via `/cmd:execute-plan <plan> --target ...` so Pi can launch from a fresh session without popping a menu,
- keeps alternate review commands such as `/review:change-claude-code` as explicit opt-ins rather than hidden plan-mode fallbacks,
- disables `/plan` mode before dispatching into execution so implementation is not blocked by planning-only restrictions.

This repo also ships a maintained `pi-prd-mode` extension that:

- powers `/prd` mode for PRD/spec workflows,
- keeps PRD-mode writes scoped to `thoughts/plans/prd-*.md`, `thoughts/specs/spec-*.md`, and transient review artifacts under `thoughts/validation/prd-reviews/<prd-slug>/`,
- asks the model to compare each answer round against the intent/spec baseline and use `/prd:clarify-round` for the critical-thinker-first clarification loop,
- keeps `/review:prd` as an explicit review gate instead of auto-running it after edits,
- records PRD review approval in `thoughts/validation/prd-reviews/<prd-slug>/review-status.json`,
- prompts you to run `/review:prd` before handoff whenever the latest PRD review is missing, stale, or not approved,
- offers `/dev:plan-from-prd <prd>` as the reviewed-PRD handoff path,
- disables `/prd` before dispatching into the fresh planning session so PRD mode restrictions do not leak into execution planning.

This repo also ships `simple-multi-status.ts`, a lightweight multi-line status widget that auto-loads on install and shows:

- the active model,
- token, cache, and cost totals,
- multi-pass / multicodex status when present,
- current context-window usage,
- the current working directory.

This repo also ships `percentage-compaction.ts`, which gives you percentage-based control over context compaction:

- set a custom threshold (default 60%) for when compaction should trigger,
- proactively auto-compacts with **pi-vcc** once usage crosses the threshold,
- waits for the current assistant turn to finish before compacting so tool-driven execution is not interrupted,
- `/compact-status` to check current context usage,
- `/compact-now [instructions]` to trigger compaction manually,
- gates pi's built-in auto-compaction so it cannot fire below the configured threshold

To adjust the threshold, edit `COMPACTION_THRESHOLD_PERCENT` in the extension file (default is 60).
To use with pi-vcc, ensure the vendored local package is installed (`pi list` should show the local `_pi/packages/pi-vcc` package path).

**Note:** With the vendored pi-vcc installed, no additional compaction configuration is needed. The extension now proactively starts a pi-vcc compaction at the configured percentage threshold, and pi-vcc handles the actual algorithmic compaction when triggered. This repo now ships the `/pi-vcc` manual-bypass marker and the agent-only-tail fallback directly in the vendored package, so rerunning `./install.sh --pi` refreshes both behaviors without patching global npm files.

This repo also vendors Pi's `questionnaire.ts` extension, which auto-loads on install and provides:

- a `questionnaire` tool for asking one or more interactive questions,
- single-question option picking and multi-question tabbed flows,
- optional custom typed answers via “Type something”,
- structured result details for the agent with selected option indices and custom-answer markers.

This repo also vendors Pi's `todo.ts` extension, which auto-loads on install and provides:

- a `todo` tool for branch-aware task tracking with **proactive planning guidance** — agents are encouraged to create comprehensive todo lists BEFORE beginning work,
- a `/todos` command for inspecting the current branch todo list,
- session-detail persistence so todo state follows Pi branching correctly,
- best practices baked into the tool description: decompose tasks into small steps, update progress as you go, keep todos specific and measurable.

## Subagents

Pi subagents load agent definitions from `~/.pi/agent/agents/`.

## Package-managed Pi extensions

In addition to the repo-managed files under `~/.pi/agent/extensions/`, `install.sh --pi` also registers Pi packages via `pi install` / `pi update`. These are the entries that appear in `pi list`.

Git-managed packages:
- `chrome-cdp-skill`
- `pi-rlm`
- `pi-gpt-config`

npm-managed packages:
- `@tintinweb/pi-subagents`
- `@aliou/pi-processes`
- `pi-web-access`
- `lsp-pi`
- `@fnnm/pi-ast-grep`
- `pi-updater`
- `pi-powerline-footer`
- `pi-side-agents`
- `pi-multi-pass`
- `pi-no-soft-cursor`
- `@tmustier/pi-files-widget`
- `@tmustier/pi-raw-paste`

local path packages:
- `./_pi/packages/pi-vcc`
- `../3p/pi-interactive-shell` (preferred when present; otherwise `git:github.com/adnichols/pi-interactive-shell`)

Use `pi list` on a host to verify what is currently registered. To verify both surfaces together, run `scripts/verify-pi-install.sh` from this repo.

These files are based on `_omp/agents`, but normalized for the `@tintinweb/pi-subagents` loader:

- every agent has a `name`
- `tools` is flattened to a comma-separated built-in Pi tool list when possible
- unsupported OMP-only nested permission/tool metadata is omitted from the frontmatter used by `@tintinweb/pi-subagents`

Example installed agents:

- `developer-mid`
- `developer-mm`
- `quality-reviewer`
- `research`
- `plan-gpt5.4`
- `reviewer-plan-adversarial-gpt5.4`
- `reviewer-plan-adversarial-opus`
- `worktree-creator`

## Usage

Prompt templates:

```text
/cmd:debug login flake in CI
/dev:plan feature-name
/prd
/prd:clarify-round thoughts/plans/prd-my-feature.md
/review:plan thoughts/plans/my-plan.md
/review:plan-adversarial thoughts/plans/my-plan.md
/review:prd thoughts/plans/prd-my-feature.md
/review:change thoughts/plans/my-plan.md
/review:change-kimi thoughts/plans/my-plan.md
/review:change-opus thoughts/plans/my-plan.md
/review:change-claude-code thoughts/plans/my-plan.md
/cmd:execute-plan thoughts/plans/my-plan.md
/dev:plan-from-prd thoughts/plans/prd-my-feature.md
/cmd:send-plan-to-doct thoughts/plans/my-plan.md
```

## Reviewed-plan handoff

Use `/cmd:execute-plan <plan>` after a reviewed plan is ready to continue.

Canonical reviewed-plan flow:

```text
/dev:plan <plan>
/review:plan <plan>
/review:change-integrate <plan>
/review:plan-adversarial <plan>   # optional
/cmd:execute-plan <plan>
```

Optional second pass: run `/review:plan-adversarial <plan>` after `/review:change-integrate <plan>` when you want an explicit challenge review before execution.

- It is the canonical wrapper for choosing between `/dev:run <plan>` and `/ralph:run <plan>`.
- `/dev:run` applies one `quality-reviewer` pass after each phase; `/ralph:run` keeps looping review/fix passes until the phase is clean.
- In Pi `/plan` mode, the extension offers both execution paths as post-review exit choices and stages this handoff command for the selected target.
- When that extension path is used, `/plan` mode is disabled before execution so planning-only tool restrictions do not leak into implementation.
- In Pi, the handoff command starts a fresh session and then launches the selected execution flow from that clean context.
- `/review:change-claude-code` remains available for an explicit manual review request, but it is not part of the automatic `/plan`-mode review-to-execution path.

Use `/dev:plan-from-prd <prd>` after a reviewed PRD delta is ready to become an execution plan.

The sequence below is the end-to-end reviewed-PRD path from PRD entry through handoff. Clarification continues in `/prd` and `/prd:clarify-round` until complete before the operator runs `/review:prd`.

```text
/prd
/review:prd thoughts/plans/prd-my-feature.md
/dev:plan-from-prd thoughts/plans/prd-my-feature.md
```

- It is the canonical wrapper for turning a reviewed PRD delta into a fresh single-file plan session.
- In Pi `/prd` mode, the typical sequence is `/prd` → update the PRD with the latest user answers → `/prd:clarify-round` → repeat that clarification loop as needed → `/review:prd` when a wider review is worthwhile → `/dev:plan-from-prd <prd>` after an approved review result.
- `/review:prd` is the explicit review gate before `/dev:plan-from-prd`.
- `/review:prd` writes seven per-reviewer files under `thoughts/validation/prd-reviews/<prd-slug>/`, integrates the combined findings back into the PRD, keeps `integration-ledger.md` plus `review-status.json`, and removes the seven reviewer output files after integration.
- `/dev:plan-from-prd` validates that `thoughts/validation/prd-reviews/<prd-slug>/review-status.json` exists, is approved, and is not older than the PRD.
- If the latest review result for the same PRD is `needs_changes`, resolve the inline `[REVIEW:...]` comments in that PRD and rerun `/review:prd <prd-path>`.
- If the latest review result for the same PRD is `review_failed`, inspect `thoughts/validation/prd-reviews/<prd-slug>/integration-ledger.md` for the failed reviewer row(s) and notes, resolve the failed review-cycle cause(s), and rerun `/review:prd <prd-path>`.
- If the latest review result for the same PRD is stale, or the same PRD does not yet have a current approved review result, rerun `/review:prd <prd-path>` before handoff.
- The extension does not auto-run `/review:prd`; that gate is explicit and should happen only once the intent is clarified.
- When the handoff path is used, `/prd` mode is disabled before planning so PRD-only tool restrictions do not leak into execution planning.
- In Pi, the handoff command starts a fresh session and then continues the planning work from that clean context.

## Notes

- Pi global resources live under `~/.pi/agent/`, not `~/.pi/`.
- Repo-managed extensions live in `~/.pi/agent/extensions/`; package-managed installs are reported by `pi list`.
- `~/.pi/agent/APPEND_SYSTEM.md` is installed from the repo-root `APPEND_SYSTEM.md`; OMP receives that same shared source as `~/.omp/agent/SYSTEM.md`.
- Project-local Pi resources can also live under `.pi/prompts/`, `.pi/skills/`, `.pi/agents/`, and `.pi/extensions/`.
- Pi natively auto-discovers both `~/.agents/skills/` and `~/.pi/agent/skills/`; this repo uses `~/.agents/skills/` as the canonical shared runtime location and reserves `~/.pi/agent/skills/` for Pi-local-only entries. Repo-owned skill payloads come from `skills/`, while package-backed entries are fetched per `skills/install-matrix.json`.
- `@tintinweb/pi-subagents`-compatible agent definitions install to `~/.pi/agent/agents/`.
